# Entry 1: My Topic is Cooking
##### 10/25/23

### Context
  The topic i decided to choose was Cooking because its a skill that can be shown to care about someone , but also it can really make eating an experience itself. when studying futher into cooking i can see in many ways of how Technology is incorperated into Cooking. Some websites that were helpful were [Engadget]( https://www.engadget.com/2016-09-23-how-tech-has-changed-how-we-cook.html) and [importance of technology](https://importanceoftechnology.net/importance-of-technology-in-cooking/) since it really talks about how technology has been used in Cooking and how its growing modernally. After years of Cooking we now depend on technology a lot more since its a way to share different cultures, but also make cooking a little easier. 

## Engineering/Technological Design Process
Though Technology is something we have built a lot on and benefits us in cooking, i think it has kind of buried the true skill of cooking. In the past we didn't have all these ways of timing or even measuring, which really sharpened our senses. The bigger problem is most likely how we are leaning more in ***Artificial foods*** which is really not good for us and it can really damage our health. In step 2 i am researching more into how Artificial foods are made and modified and how it affects our health.

## Skills
Something ive learned is ***Time Management*** and ***Paying attention*** during this process.

### Time management
So far with all my extracurriculars and homework from school its been a little challenging maintaining motivation with all these tasks. One thing i tell myself so i can keep going is to just make it till friday since thats when the week is over and ive mostly gotten my tests and projects done. Words of motivation not only makes the week go by faster but also helps me keep on task with my work. Time managment includes cooking since cooking involves time and work.

### Paying attention
Another skill i have learned is ***Paying attention*** which really is important in many ways and aspects. Paying attention is very important because thats how we learn and operate everyday things. Not only do you Pay attention in school, but you also pay attention when cooking because if you don't then accidents could happen or loss of knowledge.
